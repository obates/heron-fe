This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Considerations

- I've committed the .env.local file for demo purposes. I would expect this file to be populated by the CI.
- I've installed Prettier (instead of ESLint) for linting as it is out-the-box & opinionated. 
- Client-side data fetching v.s. server-side rendered v.s. static
- Tests using React Testing Library & Jest. Could investigate Cypress etc.

## Future Ideas / Improvements
